        <h2>Stakeholder Analysis</h2>
        <p>
          When designing our system, we considered the following stakeholders:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li><b>Governments of coastal nations.</b> Governments have a duty to protect their citizens from disasters such as oil spills; as such, they would be very interested in minimizing the damage caused by spills. Note that, although our system is focused on US coasts, other nations such as Mexico may still be affected by spills occurring in these regions if they were to go unchecked.</li>
          <li><b>Residents of coastal communities.</b> Citizens who live near coasts will have their lives adversely affected by oil spills due to polluted water, bad smells, and less attractive beaches.</li>
          <li><b>Coastal vacationers.</b> Even of people who do not live near coasts, many enjoy vacationing near coastal areas. Their vacations would certainly be less enjoyable if the beach they visited was covered in spilt oil.</li>
          <li><b>Seafood-based businesses.</b> Companies who rely on seafood for their business will find themselves short on supply if an oil spill contaminates an area that is normally a source of seafood.</li>
          <li><b>Oil companies.</b> Companies who rely on oil for their business will not only lose supply due to oil spills, but may face public backlash and major public relations problems if the oil spill goes on too long or causes too much damage (BP faced this very problem when their infamous Deepwater Horizon oil spill occurred).</li>
          <li><b>Businesses reliant on oil.</b> Many companies are reliant on oil, either directly (e.g. gas stations) or indirectly (e.g. any company that transports goods by truck). The wasted oil supply due to a spill may result in increased oil prices, negatively affecting these businesses.</li>
          <li><b>Businesses reliant on coastal tourism.</b> As mentioned above, an oil spill would make coastal vacations less enjoyable. This could seriously hurt companies who rely on coastal tourism, such as hotels and restaurants.</li>
          <li><b>Navies.</b> Oil spills would make naval operations much more difficult in affected areas, thus making life more difficult for navies operating in those areas.</li>
          <li><b>Sea creatures.</b> Oil spills would have terrible effects on the lives of sea creatures near the areas of spills, polluting their habitat.</li>
          <li><b>Coastal creatures.</b> Beyond sea creatures themselves, many animals such as birds live near the ocean and rely on sea creatures to eat. These animals would be very hurt by oil spills, both due to direct effects of pollution and due to the loss of their food supply.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Needs</h2>
        <p>
          Based on the stakeholder listed above and the functions described in our functional analysis, we devised the following list of needs.
        </p>
        <img src="../img/needsTable.png"/>
      </div>

      <div id="ahp">
        <h2>Needs Prioritization (AHP)</h2>
        <p>
          To select a design, a process known as Analytic Hierarchy Process was used. The needs were compared one-on-one and were ranked from the least important to the most important. First, a scale was defined, with 1 being neutral and 9 being extremely prefered.
        </p>
        <img src="../img/needsScale.png"/>
        <p>
          Each need was then compared with another need, and given a score. For example, Need # 1 is extremely prefered compared to Need # 4.
        </p>
        <img src="../img/prioritizationMatrix.png"/>
        <p>
          The columns were added. To standardize the column scores, the values in the columns were divided by the total to make the sum equal to 1, as it can be seen in the table below. By averaging the rows, a final score was determined for each need and ranked. It would appear that Need # 8 takes the most priority and Need # 4 takes the least. Therefore, the need that the system accurately assesses oil spills progress and severity takes precedence over the need that the system is politically feasible.
        </p>
        <img src="../img/prioritizationMatrixStandardized.png"/>
        <p>
          All the other needs are ranked accordingly, from 1 to 8, with 1 being the most important and 8 being the least.
        </p>
        <img src="../img/needsRankings.png"/>
      </div>

      <div id="reqs">
        <h2>Requirements</h2>
        <p>
          Based on our needs analysis, we were able to generate a list of specific requirements for our system. Note that a false negative inspection refers to an instance in which the system inspects an area with an oil spill but fails to detect or report the spill, while a false positive inspection refers to an instance in which the system reports an oil spill that is not actually there. Also note that minimum component reliability refers to the reliability of the least-reliable component of the system. Finally, note that Importance is ranked from 1 to 5, with 1 being least important and 5 being most important.
        </p>

      </div>

      <div id="hoq">
        <h2>House of Quality</h2>
        <p>
          From the requirements table alone it may be unclear exactly how our needs and requirements relate. To make this more clear, we created a House of Quality showing relationships and importance of needs and requirements. We also utilized this House of Quality to consider the performance of other oil-spill-detecting products from competitors. Note that we were not able to directly compare these products to ours as we had not yet generated an actual concept for our system.
        </p>
        <p>
          The House of Quality is too large and complex to be viewed as anything other than a Microsoft Excel file, but it can be downloaded <a href="../doc/HOQ.xlsx">here</a>.
